You can review the homework and the project work on this website for IE582.

[Homework 1](files\HW1\HW1.html): Exploring the relationships between the design parameters of an antenna and its electromagnetic performance using machine learning techniques. Also, it can be seen Explatory Data Analysis report of used data in this homework [here](files\HW1\HW1_EDA.html)

[Homework 2](files\HW2\HW2.html): Focused on live betting forecasting for football matches, analyzing the efficiency of betting odds and identifying inefficiencies. Applied boosting tree models to solve this multiclass classification problem, aiming to predict optimal betting outcomes. Also, it can be seen Explatory Data Analysis report of used data in this homework [here](files\HW2\HW2_EDA.html)

[Project](files\Project\Project.pdf): Optimizing Live Betting Strategy on footbal matches, using supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Codes of the project can be found [here](files\Project\model_training.ipynb)

It can be seen Explatory Data Analysis report of used data before any manipulation in this project [here](files\Project\Project_EDA.html). Data cleaning, imputation and feature engineering steps done in this [code file](files\Project\data_prep.ipynb), after these steps Explatory Data Analysis had been done one more time and it can be found [here](files\Project\Project_Imputed_Data_EDA.html).
